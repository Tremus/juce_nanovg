# juce_nanovg

NanoVG graphics module for JUCE, based on https://github.com/Archie3d/juce_bgfx

Contains a LowLevelGraphicsContext and attachable component for rendering JUCE projects with NanoVG. See the example to find out how to implement this yourself.

A work-in-progress, currently only works on MacOS with Metal and Windows with DirectX 11. I expect to add better Linux support at some point, but if you have experience with NanoVG, OpenGL or Vulkan, let me know!
