# juce_nanovg
NanoVG graphics module for JUCE, based on https://github.com/Archie3d/juce_bgfx

Contains a LowLevelGraphicsContext and attachable component for rendering JUCE projects with NanoVG. See the example to find out how to implement this yourself.

A work-in-progress, currently only works on MacOS with Metal and (sort of) on Linux with OpenGL. I expect to add Windows and better Linux support at some point, but if you have experience with nanovg, openGL or Vulcan, let me know!
